# Filtering data - A more flexible approach

Now time passes by and you have another requirement, that you want to keep only negative numbers.

You have to implement a new filter method for that. ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ 

Or is there a more flexible way?

What if we could pass our expression to the filter method before as function pointer or delegate?

# Here comes the Func

Luckily, whe have a delegate type called `System.Func<>`.
With this type we can assign a function to a variable or an argument of a method.

`Func<>` is a generic type (like `IEnumerable<T>`) but with at least 2 template parameters.

For example, we can assign the `IsGreaterThanZero` method to a variable of type `Func<int, bool>`, where
the first tpye is the input type (`int`) and the second type is the return type (`bool`).
```c#
Func<int, bool> greaterZero = IsGreaterThanZero;
```
You can also have more than one input types.
For example, `Func<int, int, bool>` takes two ints as input and returns a boolean.
The last type is always the method's return type and the types before define the method's input types (one per argument).

# Here is the code

## The code explained

We pulled out all the logic into a method called `FilterNumbers`.
This method takes the source items as first argument and an predicate function delegate as second argument.

The difference to the previous version is, that we don't call `IsGreaterThanZero` in the if statement.
Instead, we call the `filterPredicate` argument as a function.

Our `KeepPositiveNumbers` method from the previous example now can call `FilterNumbers` and pass in `IsGreaterThanZero` as the filter predicate.

We've also implemented `KeepNegativeNumbers` and a filter method `IsSMallerThanZero` the same way.

# This is it?

Passing delegate methods as arguments is an elegant way to reduce implementation effort required by the one who implemented the filter method.
Iterating over the input is always the same and responsibility for deciding which items are kept is delegated to the caller.

However, the way we pass the delegate function introduces more complexity on the caller's side.
A separate method has to be defined and passed to `FilterNumbers`.

But is there an easier way to tell `FilterNumbers` that we want to keep all number `x > 0` or `x < 0`?

You guess it, yes there is.
And the answer is lambda expressions.
