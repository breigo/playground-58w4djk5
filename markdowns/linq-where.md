# Filter data with Where

We've built up our understanding of LINQ using `Where(predicate)` in the last section.

You can apply `Where` to restrict the result set to contain only elements that satisfy a specified condition.


## Example

@[Where]({"stubs": ["Exercises/FilterPeopleWithLinq.cs"],"command": "TechIo.FilterPeopleWithLinqTest.Verify"})
